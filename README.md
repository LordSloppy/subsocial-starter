## Subsocial Starter

The starter of your social web3 journey. 

The starter is the foundational layer for using [Subsocial JS SDK](https://github.com/dappforce/subsocial-js) in a React app.  

It provides you with all set of methods, APIs, connections, etc. that you might need while writing your favourite social finance web app for your users. 

Getting started is easy, just follow the steps:

### Creating a new project using starter

- Run the command: 
```tsx
  npx create-react-app my-app --template subsocial-starter
```

### Running the project
- Change directory to `my-app` 
- Run command `yarn` to install all packages
- Run command `yarn start` to run the local project
- Congratulations, now your first Subsocial App is up and running.

Open the `my-app` directory, in a text-editor like VS Code or IDE and start building your favourite decenteralized social network. Read the comments inside the project for help.
