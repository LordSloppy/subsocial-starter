# Subsocial Starter by [DappForce](https://github.com/dappforce)

The start of your Web3 social journey. 

The starter is the foundational layer for using the [Subsocial JS SDK](https://github.com/dappforce/subsocial-js) in a React app.  

It provides you with all set of methods, APIs, connections, etc. that you might need while building viral social web apps for your users. 

Getting started is easy, just follow the steps:

## Creating a new starter project

- Run the command: 
```tsx
  npx create-react-app my-app --template @subsocial/starter
```

## Running the project

- Change the directory to `my-app` 
- Run the command `yarn` to install all the packages
- Run the command `yarn start` to start the local project
- Congratulations, now your first Subsocial App is up and running.

Congratulations, now your first Subsocial App is up and running
